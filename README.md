# linky

Linky is a personal project for a website linking to profiles on several social media platforms.
It is focused on aesthetics and a fast first site load.

## Features

- Responsive design fitting portrait and landscape mobile as well as desktop layouts
- Always fits exactly on the screen, no scrolling
- Wave animation and particles in pure CSS + HTML
- Pretty opening animations on site load
- Subset font for reduced size
- Inline styles, including the font, to display the entire site after the first request
- Embedded [ThumbHash](https://evanw.github.io/thumbhash/) previews to avoid ugly blank spaces whilst the images are loading
- Minified CSS and JS for faster site load
- Pre-compressed brotli to avoid on-the-fly encoding

## Screenshots

**Note:** The screenshots use a placeholder picture. The portrait layout looks much better with
an actual banner instead of a stretched out avatar.
